## Project: CF Madness (sports bracket app)

CF Madness is an application allows users to compete against their friends by choosing winners for real world sports games. 

You are able to create and manage your own leagues and will have a personal scoreboard for each participant. Each league will also have its own message board that will allow you to communicate with those in your league. Each league also has the option to be private or public.

If you are not participating in a league or would like to communicate with those outside of your league, you can also create a group. Like a league, each group has its own message board so users can communicate with each other.

## How to use?
Clone this repo, cd into the root of the project, run `npm i` from your command line to install all of our dependencies. Please make sure that you have mongodb and httpie installed on your machine, you can brew install them both if you do not already have them `brew install httpie mongodb`. Please refernce the installation instructions for MongoDB `https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/`, there is typically 1 or 2 quick things you need to do after you Brew install it. 

Run `npm run start` from terminal to start the server. Open a new tab in terminal and run `mongod` to start the Mongo process. Open another terminal tab and run `mongo` to open a Mongo shell (for viewing the contents of your local database). Lastly, open up a final terminal tab; this is where you will be making all of your server requests, instructions and examples are below.

## Routes

### Auth/User Routes
#### POST: `/api/signup`
Create a new  user with the properties `username`, `email`, `password` and `findHash` (findHash is automatically created for you).

```
http POST :3000/api/signup username=newusername email=newemail@gmail.com password=newpassword
http POST :3000/api/signup username=<username> email=<email> password=<password>
```
#### GET: `/api/signin`
As an existing user you can login to your profile, which will authenticate you with a json web token and allow you to make requests to our API.
```
http POST :3000/api/signup username=newusername email=newemail@gmail.com password=newpassword
http POST :3000/api/signup username=<username> email=<email> password=<password>
```
Throws an error if any of the requested properties that are not created for you are missing.

The User model will return a json web token if there are no errors and create a profile model for the newly instantiated user to add more detailed information to.

### Profile Routes
#### GET: `/api/profile/<profile id>`
Retrieve your user profile and update your information for other users to see.

```
http -a newusername:newpassword :3000/api/signin
http -a <username>:<password> :3000/api/signin
```
Throws an error if any of the requested properties that are not created for you are missing.

The User model will return a json web token if there are no errors.
#### PUT: `/api/profile/<profile id>`

### `Sporting Event Routes`
#### POST: `/api/sportingevent`

Add a sporting event with the properties `name`, `desc`, `createdOn`, and `tags`. The property `createdOn` is generated automatically and the `tags` property is available for any extra information that a user may want to add.

```
http POST :3000/api/sportingevent 'Authorization:Bearer <token>' sportingEventName='<event name>' desc='<description>'
```
After a successful POST, you receive an object of the new sporting event you created, like the example below:
```
{
    "__v": 0, 
    "_id": "5aa9acbe42358a6e7b6a6450", 
    "createdOn": "2018-03-14T23:14:06.602Z", 
    "desc": "some text and stuff", 
    "sportingEventName": "baseball", 
    "tags": []
}
```

#### GET: `/api/sportingevent/<sporting event id>`

```
http GET :3000/api/sportingevent/<sporting event id> 'Authorization:Bearer <token>'
```

This will return an object of your sporting event, like the example below:
```
{
    "__v": 0, 
    "_id": "5aa9acbe42358a6e7b6a6450", 
    "createdOn": "2018-03-14T23:14:06.602Z",
