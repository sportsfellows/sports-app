## Project: CF Madness (sports bracket app)

CF Madness is an application allows users to compete against their friends by choosing winners for real world sports games. 

You are able to create and manage your own leagues and will have a personal scoreboard for each participant. Each league will also have its own message board that will allow you to communicate with those in your league. Each league also has the option to be private or public.

If you are not participating in a league or would like to communicate with those outside of your league, you can also create a group. Like a league, each group has its own message board so users can communicate with each other.

## How to use?
Clone this repo, cd into the root of the project, run `npm i` from your command line to install all of our dependencies. Please make sure that you have mongodb and httpie installed on your machine, you can brew install them both if you do not already have them `brew install httpie mongodb`. Please refernce the installation instructions for MongoDB `https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/`, there is typically 1 or 2 quick things you need to do after you Brew install it. 

Run `npm run start` from terminal to start the server. Open a new tab in terminal and run `mongod` to start the Mongo process. Open another terminal tab and run `mongo` to open a Mongo shell (for viewing the contents of your local database). Lastly, open up a final terminal tab; this is where you will be making all of your server requests, instructions and examples are below.

### Auth/User Routes

http POST :3000/api/signup username=<username> email=<email> password=<password>
