## How to use?
Clone this repo, cd into `lab-brian`, run `npm install`, brew install httpie and mongodb if you do not already have them `brew install httpie mongodb`. Please refernce the installation instructions for MongoDB `https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/`, there is typically 1 or 2 quick things you need to do after you Brew install it. 

Run `npm run start` from terminal to start the server. Open a new tab in terminal and run `mongod` to start the Mongo process. Open another terminal tab and run `mongo` to open a Mongo shell. Lastly, open up a final terminal tab; this is where you will be making all of your server requests, instructions and examples are below.

Make POST/GET/DELETE/PUT requests to the server and your local MongoDB.

## Routes

#### `POST /api/signup && /api/list`

Create a new  user with the properties `username`, `email`, `password` and `findHash` which is created for you. Or create a new list with the properties `name`, `desc`, and `created` along with `userID` which are created for you.

```
http POST :3000/api/signup username=briguy999 email=brianbixby0@gmail.com password=password1

http POST :3000/api/list name='my cool list' desc='this list is so cool'
```

Throws an error if any of the requested properties that are not created for you are missing.

The User model will return a json web token and the list model will return a new list if there are no errors.

#### `GET /api/signin && /api/list/<list id>  && /api/lists`

Retrieve the json web token for a created user, or retrieve a single list or all lists for an authenticated user.

```
http -a <username>:<password> :3000/api/signin
http -a <username>:<password> :3000/api/list/<list id>
http -a <username>:<password> :3000/api/lists
```

Throws an error if the route can't be found, the list id is invalid or the use is not authenticated.

#### `DELETE /api/list/<list id>`

Deletes a specific list as requested by the <list id>.

```
http -a <username>:<password> DELETE :3000/api/list/<list id>
```

If successful, a 204 status is returned.

Throws an error if the request parameter (id) is missing or the user is not authenticated.


#### `PUT /api/list/<list id>`

Updates a Jlist with the properties `name`, `desc`, `created` and `userID` from your MongoDB as requested by the <list id>.

```
http -a <username>:<password> PUT :3000/api/list/<list id> name='new list name'
```

If successful, the list is returned with a 200 status.

If a request is made with a list id that is not found, a 404 status is returned.

If a request is made with no list id a 400 status is returned.

If a request is made with out an authenticated user a 401 status is returned.
