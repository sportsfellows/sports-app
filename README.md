// Review: Here are some general comments:

// Review: Overall the readme is good, but there are some inconsistencies and pieces missing that you might want to add.

// Review: In some instances you show a sample response, but in many you don't. It's usually nice to know what to expect.

// Review: You have linked resources, which means you need to make some before you can make others, you might want to indicate when that is true.

// Review: Overall I'd say you've done a great job showing what routes there are and how to use them, but I am at a loss for understanding how to actually do anything, or to what end. The app is so big and there are so many different things to do it feels overwhelming. It would be super helpful if you could provide some examples of how someone might actually use this, like a quick little demo/walkthrough to show not only how to interact with the routes, but in what order and to what end.

## Project: CF Madness (sports bracket app)

CF Madness is an application allows users to compete against their friends by choosing winners for real world sports games. 

You are able to create and manage your own leagues and will have a personal scoreboard for each participant. Each league will also have its own message board that will allow you to communicate with those in your league. Each league also has the option to be private or public.

If you are not participating in a league or would like to communicate with those outside of your league, you can also create a group. Like a league, each group has its own message board so users can communicate with each other.

## How to use?
Clone this repo, cd into the root of the project, run `npm i` from your command line to install all of our dependencies. Please make sure that you have mongodb and httpie installed on your machine. You can brew install them both if you do not already have them with `brew install httpie mongodb`. Please refernce the installation instructions for MongoDB `https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/`, there are typically 1 or 2 quick things you need to do after you Brew install it. 

Run `npm run start` from terminal to start the server. Open a new tab in terminal and run `mongod` to start the Mongo process. Open another terminal tab and run `mongo` to open a Mongo shell (for viewing the contents of your local database). Lastly, open up a final terminal tab; this is where you will be making all of your server requests. Instructions and examples are below.

// Review: you should also indicate what environment variables a user would need to put into their .env

## Routes

### Auth/User Routes
#### POST: `/api/signup`
Create a new  user with the properties `username`, `email`, `password` and `findHash`, (findHash is automatically created for you).

http POST :3000/api/signup username=<username> email=<email> password=<password>
```
#### GET: `/api/signin`
As an existing user you can login to your profile, which will authenticate you with a json web token and allow you to make requests to our API.

// Review: looks like you copied and pasted the code from above but didn't change it.
```
http POST :3000/api/signup username=newusername email=newemail@gmail.com password=newpassword
http POST :3000/api/signup username=<username> email=<email> password=<password>
```
Throws an error if any of the requested properties that are not created for you are missing.

// Review: Doesn't this happen on signup, not signin?

The User model will return a json web token if there are no errors, and create a profile model for the newly instantiated user to add more detailed information to.

### Profile Routes
#### GET: `/api/profile/<profile id>`
Retrieve your user profile and update your information for other users to see.

// Review: the routes in the codeblock beloew don't match what you've listed above

http -a <username>:<password> :3000/api/signin
```
Throws an error if any of the requested properties that are not created for you are missing.

// Review: is this line valid here? You get a JWT when getting your profile?

The User model will return a json web token if there are no errors.

## Tests

// Review: Don't forget about starting mongo! Maybe explain a little bit about what the tests test?

Tests are ran by using the jest testing suite. To run tests, first you must download and copy this repo and run `npm i` in the root directory to install all application dependancies. Run `npm run test` in the root directory of the application in your terminal to check tests.
